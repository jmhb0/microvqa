# MicroVQA
This is the code for the MicroVQA benchmark (hosted on [ðŸ¤—HuggingFace here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microvqa/microvqa)) and the ðŸ¤–RefineBot method that removes language shortcuts from multiple-choice evaluations. They were published in the paper: [MicroVQA: A Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Microscopy-Based Scientific Research](https://jmhb0.github.io/microvqa/). 

The repo contains:
- `eval` evaluation code for the MicroVQA benchmark (hosted on [ðŸ¤—HuggingFace here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microvqa/microvqa)).
- `refinebot` is the ðŸ¤–RefineBot method for removing language shortcuts from MCQs. 
- `benchmark` is code used in benchmark construction.
