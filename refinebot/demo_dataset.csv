In cryo-electron tomography of HCoV-NL63 virions embedded in vitreous ice (Image {img_0}), what is a potential limitation that could affect the accuracy of viral morphology interpretation, and how might this limitation impact subsequent structural analyses?","['Limited resolution of cryo-electron tomography prevents visualization of large-scale structural features, hindering the identification of overall virion shape.', 'Motion blur from the dynamic nature of virions can obscure fine structural details, leading to incomplete or misleading information about viral morphology.', 'Excessive staining in vitreous ice enhances contrast but may introduce artifacts that falsely represent viral components.', 'Rapid freezing preserves native structures too effectively, making it difficult to manipulate and analyze virions during imaging.']",1,

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) images of mitochondria from neurites of Q18 human iPSC-neurons and more severe Huntingtons disease (HD) genotypes were analyzed. In the segmented and color-coded Image 1, the cristae membranes (cyan) in Q18 mitochondria appear more intact compared to those in more severe HD genotypes. What is the most likely reason for the observed integrity of cristae membranes in Q18 mitochondria?","['Increased expression of protective mitochondrial proteins in Q18 neurons', 'Q18 represents a less severe form of HD with fewer polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein', 'Enhanced mitochondrial DNA replication in Q18 neurons', 'Greater availability of cellular ATP in Q18 neurons']",1,

A cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) study compared mitochondria in neurites from Q18 human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons with those from neurons with more severe Huntingtons Disease (HD) genotypes. The mitochondria in Q18 neurons exhibited relatively intact cristae structures, whereas mitochondria in more severe HD genotypes showed swollen or barely visible cristae.

What is the most likely explanation for the preservation of cristae structures in Q18 mitochondria compared to those in more severe HD genotypes?","['Q18 mitochondria have increased levels of antioxidant enzymes that protect cristae integrity.', 'A lower number of polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein reduces mitochondrial dysfunction and preserves cristae structure.', 'Enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in Q18 neurons compensates for structural defects.', 'Q18 neurons express an alternative form of huntingtin that does not interact with mitochondrial membranes.']",1,
